  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract = {The uncertain infection transmission causes challenges in accurate disease prediction. Numerous methods have been proposed to capture the temporal pictures from past observations within equal time intervals, which are called single-grained time series. However, these methods are not suitable for capturing uncertain temporal dynamics from infectious disease time series, since the infectious diseases may propagate in the incubation period. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Dual-Grained Directional Representation (DGDR) to generate predictions, via consolidating the representations of an equal-grained time series and several fine-grained time series. Firstly, the proposed DGDR learns a transformed segmentation into three kinds of representations. And then those representations from both equal-grained data and fine-grained data are temporally consolidated to connect with outputs. Extensive experiments on two real infectious disease datasets are done to validate the proposed DGDR. Compared with the other twelve methods, MAE value is decreased by 31.5%, RMSE value is decreased by 29.9%, and R2 value is improved by 87.6%.},

Existing predictive methods commonly learn the development patterns from historical observations. However, almost all these methods are neglect the immediate impact of exogenous factors on HFMD transmission. To solve the limitation, we consider the approximately unidirectional influences from temperature to confirmed cases and then propose a transfer one-step-ahead learning (Tr-OSH) method to establish their association. The Tr-OSH method first extract the unidirectional representation from temperature observations, and subsequently transfer the obtained representation for HFMD cases prediction. Moreover, we notice the independent correlation of each time step and period, and generate the independent representation by the relevance to upcoming values. Intensive experiments on real-world HFMD datasets demonstrate that our Tr-OSH method much efficaciously improves prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Heat load prediction is essential for energy efficiency and carbon reduction in district heating systems. However, heat load is influenced by many factors, such as building characteristics, consumption behavior, and climate, making its prediction challenging. Traditional methods based on physical models are complex and insufficiently accurate, whereas most data-driven statistical methods ignore customer energy consumption behaviors and their correlation, and do not account for the temporal inertia of consumption. This paper proposes a graph ambient intelligence (GAIN) method for heat load prediction, which classifies customers based on their load profiles and uses collaborative attention on temporal graphs to capture their associations and the weather impact on heat loads. GAIN also incorporates recursive and autoregressive methods to model the temporal inertia of consumption. The proposed method is evaluated on four metrics and compared with fifteen baseline methods. The results show that GAIN achieves the lowest daily forecasting errors in terms of RMSE, MAE, and CV-RMSE, with values of 6.972, 4.442, and 0.191, respectively. Besides, the proposed method achieves a maximum reduction of 25%, 29%, and 25% in RMSE, MAE, and CV-RMSE, respectively, compared to other methods when taking meteorological factors into account.},

Several attention-based predictive models can be applied to undertake the prediction task. However, using a single attention mechanism can only capture local information, i.e. part of the temporal dynamics from time series. In this paper, we take for the hypothesis that using multiple attention from different aspects could improve prediction accuracy. An oriented attention model (OAM) is proposed to draw temporal dynamics in several aspects, via oriented attention units and their aggregation. Firstly, time series are represented as oriented transformations. And then those representations are consolidated to connect with outputs. Intensive experiments on two real infectious disease datasets show OAM‚Äôs effectiveness.},
