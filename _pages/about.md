Hi! I am currently a first-year Master’s student at the Yang Loo Lin School of Medicine, [National University of Singapore](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/), majoring in Precision Health and Medicine. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics from School of Science, Jimei University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Zhijin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKUpBpMAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My research focuses on time series forecasting, smart healthcare, and developing robust and efficient algorithms driven by practical problems.
